# HOV-AV_paper
This repository contains the analysis work of Hella's HOV lanes for AV paper. 


## 26th July 2022

Figured out a good way to store the large data files without copying them several times. And also load them from one place regardless of whatever notebook I will be working on. 

Also, knocked Fan Zuo for help and he came over and explained the results files data headers clearly and narrated through one agent's entire day.  For my personal visualization, it is important for me to just look at the dep_time and trav_time values. 


Explored the `Counter` subclass from `collections`.

Wanted to find out the actual population.  Tried to do it from the counter.  Because it gives the number of trips for each agent. But I couldn't figure out a way to find the 'len' of a counter object. 

Actually it would be easier to just find the number of unique values in the ID column.

Calculated the modal split. 


Calculated the average travel time  and distance for base scenario. 

Now do it for S1 scenario. 


## 5th August 2022

Trying to redo everything so far in a clean manner. 

Can I plot the ridership?

First, how do I see what kind of variable a variable is? Sol: Use `type(variable)`

Ok, plotted some bar charts. 

Now how do I see the quick increase decrease difference between the two scenarios?


## 9th August 2022

TODO:   Check the difference between two scenarios above. 

But first  - let's finite the notebook. 

Opened a new notebook to do clean analysis and add my stuff.

Original notebook is only going to be used for Hella's work exploration and my draft ideas. 


----------

Tried to generate CSV files from XML files for Scenario 2 and 3.  Hella gave me a Python notebook she received from Ding, which does this conversion. 

However, the entire thing took so long!  I think I waited for 1.5 hours.  Hella had mentioned, on Desktop it took about 20 minutes. 

Anyway will take the files generated by Hella before. 

However I think I had developed the correct process. It was only my laptop which is not powerful enough. 

Process for future: 

1. Download xml.gz files. 
2. Extract using 7-zip. Will get xml file. 
3. Modify the path names in the Python notebook (both for the input xml files and the output result.csv and score.csv files)
4. Run it
